# catalogue-demo

## Purpose
The purpose of this little project is merely to be an example of a simple frontend CRUD system.

## How it works
Catalogue items can be added, removed and updated, with the data stored in localStoarge.
Items are in the format of books, requiring only a title and the name of an author, and a unique Id is generated for each.
Checks are in place to prevent duplicates, either when creating new items or editing existing ones.
Items can also be sorted and filtered.
